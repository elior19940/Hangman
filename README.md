# Hangman
Welcome to my implementation of the classic word guessing game, Hangman! This is my first Python project, so please bear with me as I learn and improve my skills.

## How to play
The game will choose a random word from a list of words and display a number of blank spaces, one for each letter in the word. The player will then guess letters, trying to fill in the blanks and guess the word before running out of chances.

For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman diagram will be drawn. The player loses the game if the entire hangman is drawn before the word is guessed.

How to run the game
To run the game, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download Python 3 here.

Once you have Python 3 installed, you can clone this repository or download the hangman.py file. Navigate to the directory containing the file in your terminal, and then run the command python hangman.py to start the game.

Additional features
In addition to the basic gameplay, I have also implemented the following features:

The ability to choose the number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game is lost (also known as the "hangman's noose")
A list of words from which the game can choose, so that the player can play multiple rounds without seeing the same word twice
The option to play again after the game ends
I hope you enjoy playing Hangman! If you have any suggestions for improvements or encounter any bugs, please feel free to open an issue on the repository or contact me directly.
